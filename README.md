# Concept
## AnimationManager
The AnimationManager will store the global settings and manage all stuff common to all animations

# Integration
## On standard BGA project
Copy bga-animations.js file to the `modules` directory.
Then you can include the module on your game :

JS file:
```js
define([
   "dojo","dojo/_base/declare",
   "dojo/debounce",
   "ebg/core/gamegui",
   /*...,*/
   g_gamethemeurl + "modules/bga-animations.js",
],
function (dojo, declare, debounce, gamegui, /*...,*/ bgaAnimations) {
```

See [examples](./EXAMPLES.md) to see how to create a manager to call animations functions.
